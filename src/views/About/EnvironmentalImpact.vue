          <p>EPS ( Commonly referred to as Styrofoam) is pervasive in the marine environment. The ubiquity, durability and ability to accumulate high levels of persistent pollutants make EPS products extremely harmful. EPS photo degrades, meaning it breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces and marine animals easily mistake it for food. EPS does not decompose and will continue to accumulate in the environment we depend on for our food. Chemically, absorbent properties make EPS even more dangerous. "Polystyrene foams essentially act like little pollutant sponges, picking up and concentrating some of the nastiest contaminants in the ocean... It is very worrisome to me that some of these plastic-feeding fish may be ending up back on our tables." - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33334994" target="_blank" nofollow>(source)</a></p>  
          <p>In 1986, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the polystyrene manufacturing process was the fifth largest source of hazardous waste. Styrene has been linked to adverse health effects in humans, and in 2014, it was listed as a possible carcinogen.</p>
          <p>Recycling EPS has been a failure in most cities because of food waste contamination and its low market value.</p>

          <h2>WHAT EPS DOES TO THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
          <h3>How do Recycling Plants breakdown EPS?</h3>
          <p>Polystyrene, commonly referred to as Styrofoam™, is extremely difficult to dispose of properly, and it releases dangerous styrene into virtually all living creatures. After it has been used, polystyrene food packaging is typically not “clean” enough to be recycled, and only 1.3% of total polystyrene was recycled in the US in 2015. Even when it is clean enough to recycle, only about 5% of the volume of Styrofoam is actually polystyrene, and the rest is air, making Styrofoam uneconomical to collect and store for recycling. In rare instances, manufacturers who handle large amounts of polystyrene will consolidate their scrap materials with compactors (compressing them to less than a tenth of their original volume), and then will sell the compacted blocks of polystyrene to recyclers. However, the polystyrene in these blocks cannot be recovered for use in new polystyrene products. Its quality is only adequate to use as filler in other plastics, which then, in turn, becomes virtually impossible to recycle. - <a href="https://www.worldcentric.com/blog/impacts-and-risks-of-styrofoam" target="_blank" nofollow>(source)</a></p>
